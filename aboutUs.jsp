					<h6 style="margin-bottom: 5px; color: #7bd10d;">Our why</h6>
					<p>peerHuntr is built on the simple foundation that recruitment and HR development should be based on honesty with personality placed at the center of attention. We want to remove the filters and present more authentic candidate profiles. We believe this will create a better match between employee and employer, and lead to more fulfilled professional lives.

In today’s world, too much attention, in our opinion, is placed on appearances creating a false sense of reality. By portraying ourselves in an honest and authentic manner, we are able to stay true to ourselves. We also believe that technology increasingly means that the working life and the personal life blends together. Technology means that we take work home on our smart phones and tablets, but it also means that we bring our private lives to work with our social media presence. Given this reality, we believe that work tools should be fun and engaging. If work no longer feels like work, but more like professional playtime, we have accomplished our mission.

That mission, then, is to make recruitment and HR development honest and engaging, while placing personality at the center of attention.</p>

					<h6 style="margin-bottom: 5px; color: #7bd10d;">Our vision</h6>
					<p>Following from the above mission, we aspire to become one of the world’s leading recruitment and HR development platforms. </p>

<h6 style="margin-bottom: 5px; color: #7bd10d;">The peerHuntr mindset</h6>
<p>Traditional recruiting and headhunting prioritizes skills and competences over personality. At peerHuntr, we do the opposite. We believe that employers must first ensure that the personality of the candidate is a fit with the culture of the employer. The reason is that studies continue to show that most recruitments fail, not for lack of competences, but because of a cultural mismatch between candidate and employer. Once a cultural match is in place, a skill gap analysis can ensure that the candidate’s skills and competencies are in place or can be developed after employment. We call this the peerHuntr mindset.</p>
<h6 style="margin-bottom: 5px; color: #7bd10d;">The personality test and types</h6>
<p>The personality test is based on the different personality types proposed by the Swiss psychologist Carl Jung in his book “Psychological Types”. There are sixteen different psychological types in the peerHuntr personality types.

Inspired by Paul D. Tieger, Barbara Barron and Kelly Tieger’s book “Do What You Are: Discover the Perfect Career for You Through the Secrets of Personality Type (2014)”, here is a short description of each personality type:</br>

You are outgoing, versatile and likeable, and although your can-do approach usually gets the job done, it does come with a risk of missed opportunities due to a lack of planning and failure to look beyond the current moment.</br>
